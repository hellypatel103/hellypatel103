### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my portfolio website to showcase my web development projects and skills.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning new web technologies and frameworks like React.js and Node.js to expand my skillset.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source web development projects to gain practical experience and contribute to the community..

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts. Java and PHP are my favorite languages to use for backend.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:hellypatel.1104@gmail.com) and also checkout my [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/helly_patel/) Profile.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her.

âš¡ Fun fact: I am always eager to learn new Technologies. I get lots of bugs while I try something new and I tend not to give up easily untill I get better at it.
